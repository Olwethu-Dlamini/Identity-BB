# 6 Functional Requirements

## Internal functional components

A common set of unique internal functional components are required to orchestrate the services of the Scheduler Building Block as shown below. The REST API's interfaces route service requests to/from external Building Blocks and appropriate internal blocks in appropriate formats. A brief description of the generic functionality of each of these components has been given below from a minimum viable product perspective. Detailed design and feature lists of these blocks can be customized by developers to optimally match specific target implementation needs.

## 6.1 Identity Usage

* Identity Building Block must offer an API to verify Identities following a Gov Stack recommended Open Standard API. (REQUIRED)
* Identity Building Block must offer an API to Verify Identity of an individual based on one of its known identifiers. (REQUIRED)
* Identity Building Block must offer an API to retrieve personal attributes of an individual from one of its identifiers. To be noted that this service will be subject to preliminary access granted by the system and by the individual (informed consent). Authorized access control should be part of API as opposed to external configuration alone. This ensures that relying parties are verified by the API before sharing sensitive data. (REQUIRED)
* Identity Building Block must offer an API to identify an unknown individual, which means retrieve an identity identifier from a set of personal attributes sent. This service is normally to be used for security/law enforcement purposes and must be limited to registries of wanted people. For privacy and security reasons, this feature should only be considered where clear and accountable security/law enforcement rules are in place. (REQUIRED)
* Identity Building Block must offer an API to verify one characteristic of an individual without having to disclose actually the recorded related attributes. The typical request response is Yes or No (sample use case: age verification, is a person older than 18 > Yes to No). (REQUIRED)
* Identity Building Block must offer Identity Verification services based on modalities listed below following a GovStack recommended Open Standard API. (REQUIRED)

#### 6.1.1 Modalities

Identity verification can be performed in several ways and based on several modalities depending on various criteria.

For example, Identity verification will be performed according to the:

* **Context of identity verification**: online, face-to-face by a third party, self-identity verification, in the absence of infrastructure and technologies.
* **Capacities given to the individual**: having an ID Card, a person Identifier, a password or PIN code, using its biometrics, mobile subscription, or smartphone.
* **Status of the individual**: can they read? Do they have usable fingerprints? Are they old enough to have an ID Card?
* **Level of trust required**: according to the sensitivity of the operations, level of assurance required, policies established by the state or by the service provider, multiple factor identity verification.
* **Business constraints**: does the use case require to be very fast, touchless, seamless, physical, or digital?
* **Local laws and regulations**: the identity verification could differ according to local regulations and laws which may indicate specific ways to perform identity verification.

Below shown table will list the different modalities that can be used to perform an identity verification, the Identity Building Block may use any of them including a combination of several of them to verify a person's identity.

Through this list of capabilities we can see there are numerous but limited options for Identity Verification that can be combined or not, this list allows us to normalize them all into the following inputs for an identity verification:

1. **Identifier**: identifier referring to a digitally retrievable identity that can give access to an individual's attributes for verification. It is noted that several kinds of identifiers could be used to refer to the same person, which is particularly important to preserve privacy (see glossary).
2. **Set of attributes**: attributes provided by the individual or retrieved on/within its Identity credential for purpose of a matching versus a reference (online or ID credential), those attributes can be biographic data, biometrics data, or scan of identity evidence.
3. **Authentication token**: A previous identity verification token can be used for identity verification, this token would allow the current service provider to verify against the authenticating system the genuineness of the token.

## 6.2 Identity Management

* Identity Building Block must offer an API to Enroll persons following a GovStack recommended Open Standard API. (REQUIRED)
* Identity Building Block must offer capacity to perform an enrollment in one step. (REQUIRED)
* Identity Building Block must offer capacity to perform an enrollment in multiple steps (i.e. demographic data collection, biometric data collections, supporting documents collections, etc.). (REQUIRED)
* Identity Building Block must offer capacity to search, retrieve and update and enrollment made (if it has not been committed yet). (REQUIRED)
* Identity Building Block must allow to control integrity and origin of an enrollment request by implementing enrollment meta-data about the context and actors of the enrollment, such as signature of data to ensure integrity. To ensure the integrity of the enrollment process, the Building Block must be able to implement technical controls so that only approved enrollment services can engage with the enrollment service. Cryptographic trust should be implemented.(REQUIRED)
* Identity Building Block must support receiving encrypted data to ensure privacy protection and prevent data theft. (REQUIRED)
* Identity Building Block must offer capacity to perform an enrollment offline which means not expecting interactions between registration client and server during the enrollment process, and data being uploaded as a whole packet. (REQUIRED)
* Identity Building Block must support porting existing demographic, biometric, and other enrollment data from external servers during enrollment process. (REQUIRED)
* Identity Building Block must keep track of the enrollment request identifiers within its internal management in order to facilitate traceability and troubleshooting. (REQUIRED)
* Identity Building Block must generate a Unique Identifier for Identity created. This number must be kept secret within the Identity Building Block. (REQUIRED)
* Identity Building Block must be capable to generate Virtual Identifier for referring to a User. The Virtual Identifier will be linked to the User's Unique Identifier. (REQUIRED)
* Identity Building Block must offer an API to revoke a Virtual Identifier. In that case, the Alias won't be usable anymore for any Identity Building Block services. (REQUIRED)
* Identity Building Block must be capable to attach an Alias Identifier to Unique Identifier for referring to a User. The alias will be an existing form of trusted identification of the User in another system. It could be for example an existing identity document number, an email address, a phone, etc. (REQUIRED)
* Identity Building Block must offer an API to revoke the link to an Alias. In that case, the Alias won't be usable anymore for any Identity Building Block services. (REQUIRED)
* Identity Building Block must offer APIs to update attributes of identities and to attach legal evidence of that identity change approval (often delivered by justice). (REQUIRED)

## 6.3 Credential Management

* Identity Building Block must offer an API to request issuance, get status and manage Identity Credentials, following a GovStack recommended Open Standard API. (REQUIRED)
* Identity Building Block must offer an API to manage the full life cycle of credentials related to an identity in an issuing system. The related credential must keep a strong and verifiable link with the individual identity and with the issuer. (REQUIRED)
* Identity Building Block API must manage Digital Credentials. (REQUIRED)
* Identity Building Block API must manage Physical Credentials. (REQUIRED)
* Identity Building Block must offer an API allowing to request an identity credential issuance to a third-party credential management system. The information sent will have to be verifiable towards their issuer for auditability purposes, so they will have to be packed into Verifiable Credential format.
* Identity Building Block must offer APIs to either push data for credential issuance in an issuance request or to be requested by the issuing system. (REQUIRED)
* Identity Building Block must offer an API allowing to issue a similar credential to the one already issued before based on the credential ID number. (REQUIRED)
* Identity Building Block must offer an API allowing to revoke an issued ID credential. This will be used, for example, when a document is damaged, stolen or definitely lost. (REQUIRED)
* Identity Building Block must offer an API allowing to temporarily suspend and then un-suspend an issued ID credential. This will be used to disable an ID credential which has been lost, its holder suspending the time to search for it. After retrieval, the document should be unsuspended and usable again. If not retrieved after some time, the document should be revoked. (REQUIRED)
* Identity Building Block must offer an API allowing to check the suspension status of a document. (REQUIRED)
